# Examples

There are multiple variations of plots that you can make. Currently you will 
need to (ab)use the `PlotKey::Custom` and the `AxisKey::Custom` variants to
fully customize your plots. These take valid PGFPlots keys, which you can browse
in the official manual. There is a set of features from LaTeX's pgfplots
missing; please open an issue for these.
